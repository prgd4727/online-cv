    summary: |
               I am a Cloud Security consultant with over 16 years’ experience in the IT Enterprise Architecture, Design and Operation teams. Worked with Hybrid Architectures with applications distributed in Data centers & Cloud, migrated data center workloads, applications and Databases to cloud, helped improve IAM posture, automate secure deployments of VMs, apps, containers and deploy security compliance and governance for Cloud. App modernization after the migration is another key focus area. I’m a DevSecOps advocate, always trying to have an Agile approach while promoting automation for appropriate use cases.
